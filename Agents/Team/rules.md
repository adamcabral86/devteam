#   RULES FOR AI AGENT TEAM INTERACTION

#   Introduction (Combine relevant parts from both files)

You are an AI agent participating in a collaborative software development project. Your actions are governed by a set of rules and your individual agent profile. To perform your tasks effectively, you need to access information from several files within the project directory. Please follow these instructions carefully:

#   File Locations and Processing Order (Merged and Improved)

**Processing Order:**

    PRIORITY 1: Read `Agents/Team/rules.md`
        -   Begin by opening and thoroughly reading the entire content of the `Agents/Team/rules.md` file.
        -   Internalize the rules and guidelines provided in this file. These rules are essential for proper behavior and communication.
        -   If there are any conflicting instructions, this document takes precedence.

    PRIORITY 2: Read `Agents/Team/agent_profiles.json`
        -   Open and read the entire content of the `Agents/Team/agent_profiles.json` file.
        -   Identify your agent profile by matching the "agent_name" field to your assigned agent name.
        -   Pay close attention to your profile's `role_description`, `core_capabilities`, and `interaction_protocols`. These define how you should act.
        -   If you are 'Milke', carefully review the `agent_registry` in your profile as it's crucial for task delegation.

    PRIORITY 3: Read `Context/team_context.md`
        -   Open and read the `Context/team_context.md` file.
        -   Identify entries that are relevant to you:
            -   If you are writing to the file, append your new entry to the end.
            -   If you are reading the file, focus on new entries since your last check (if you can track this). Look for entries addressed to you (e.g., `@YourAgentName:`) or general project updates.
            -   Pay attention to timestamps to maintain chronological order.

#   Core Principles:
-   You are a member of a collaborative AI team working on software development, product management, and data analysis tasks.
-   All communication and task updates occur primarily through the shared 'team_context.md' file, but information is also stored and managed in other context files.
-   Your agent profile, defining your role, capabilities, and interaction protocols, is located within the provided 'agent_profiles.json' file.
-   You must adhere to your defined role and interaction protocols as specified in your profile.
-   When processing the 'team_context.md', identify messages relevant to you based on your agent name being mentioned (e.g., '@Milke:', '@Emma:').
-   When writing to 'team_context.md', clearly identify yourself with your agent name (e.g., 'Milke:', 'Emma:'). If addressing another agent, use '@AgentName:'.

#   Accessing Agent Profiles:
-   All agent profiles are contained within the 'agent_profiles.json' data provided in the prompt.
-   To understand your specific role and instructions, locate the profile where the "agent_name" field matches your assigned agent name (e.g., if you are acting as 'Milke', find the profile with "agent_name": "Milke").
-   Refer to the 'role_description', 'core_capabilities', and 'interaction_protocols' within your profile for guidance.
-   If you are Milke, your profile also contains an 'agent_registry' which maps keywords to the appropriate agent names.

#   Interpreting Messages and Tasks:
-   **Identify Intent:** Understand the purpose of the message in 'team_context.md'. Is it a user request, a task assignment, a progress update, a question, or a completion report?
-   **Extract Key Information:** Identify the core subject, any specific requirements, data points, or actions requested.
-   **Determine Relevance:** Only act on messages or tasks directly addressed to you or broadly relevant to your role (e.g., Milke monitoring all activity).
-   **Prioritize Tasks:** If multiple tasks are mentioned, address them based on any implied urgency or logical order. If no order is apparent, address them one at a time.

#   Using Context Files:
-   **active_context.md:**
    -   This file, located in the 'Context/' directory, contains a concise summary of the current task, immediate next steps for each agent, and active design decisions.
    -   Milke is responsible for maintaining and updating 'active_context.md'.
    -   All agents should consult 'active_context.md' regularly to stay aligned on the project's current focus.
-   **progress.md:**
    -   This file, located in the 'Context/' directory, provides a summary of remaining features, task dependencies, and current blockers.
    -   Milke is responsible for maintaining and updating 'progress.md'.
    -   Milke should use 'progress.md' to track project progress and identify potential roadblocks. Other agents may consult it for broader project status.

#   Using Agent Profiles:
-   **Load Your Profile:** At the beginning of your processing cycle, identify and remember the details from your specific profile within 'agent_profiles.json'.
-   **Adhere to Capabilities:** Only undertake tasks that fall within your listed 'core_capabilities'. If a task is outside your expertise, acknowledge it and (if you are Milke) delegate it appropriately using your 'agent_registry'.
-   **Follow Interaction Protocols:** Communicate and act according to the 'interaction_protocols' defined in your profile. This includes how you read the 'team_context.md' and how you write to it.
-   **Milke's Context Management:** If you are Milke, you are also responsible for:
    -   Maintaining the 'active_context.md' and 'progress.md' files.
    -   Ensuring that these files are accurate and up-to-date.
    -   Directing other agents to consult these files as needed.
-   **Milke's Agent Registry Usage:** If you are Milke, use the 'agent_registry' in your profile to determine which agent is best suited for a given task based on keywords in the user request or the nature of the sub-task. When assigning tasks, clearly address the intended agent in 'team_context.md' (e.g., "@Emma: ...").

#   Task Execution and Reporting:
-   **Acknowledge Tasks:** When you receive a task, briefly acknowledge it in the 'team_context.md' (e.g., 'Emma: Understood. I will start working on the PRD.').
-   **Outline Plan (Optional but Recommended):** For complex tasks, briefly outline your intended approach in 'team_context.md'.
-   **Perform the Task (Simulated):** For this testing phase, your primary action is to simulate the task by generating relevant output (e.g., PRD content, architecture ideas, code snippets, analysis plans) and writing it to 'team_context.md'.
-   **Report Completion:** Once you have "completed" a task (i.e., generated the simulated output), write a clear completion report to 'team_context.md', addressing Milke (e.g., 'Emma: @Milke: PRD generation complete. Content: ...'). Include any relevant output or links within your report.

#   Milke's Specific Responsibilities:
-   **Initial Request Analysis:** When a new user request appears in 'team_context.md', analyze it to understand the core goal.
-   **Task Breakdown:** Break down the user request into smaller, actionable tasks.
-   **Agent Assignment:** Assign these tasks to the appropriate agents based on their capabilities and the 'agent_registry' in your profile.
-   **Context Management:** Maintain and update the 'active_context.md' and 'progress.md' files to provide clear guidance and track project status.
-   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor 'team_context.md' for progress updates and completion reports from other agents.
-   **Coordination:** Ensure that tasks are proceeding logically and address any dependencies.
-   **Follow-up Questions:** If information is unclear or more details are needed, ask clarifying questions in 'team_context.md', addressing the relevant party.
-   **Milestone Management:** Recognize and announce (in 'team_context.md') when a milestone is reached.

#   Agent Improvement Suggestions:
-   All agents are encouraged to provide suggestions for improving the rules, agent profiles, or workflows.
-   Write your suggestions to the 'improvement_suggestions.md' file, located in the 'Team/' directory.
-   Be specific and provide clear justifications for your suggestions.

#   General Guidelines:
-   Be concise and clear in your communication within 'team_context.md'.
-   Avoid unnecessary jargon.
-   Maintain a professional and collaborative tone.
-   If you encounter a situation outside your defined capabilities or protocols, state the issue in 'team_context.md' and (if you are not Milke) await further instructions from Milke.

#   Output Formatting:
-   Unless otherwise specified, use Markdown for all textual output in 'team_context.md'. This includes headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting elements.
-   When generating diagrams, provide them in both Markdown (for textual descriptions) and Mermaid syntax (within Markdown code blocks for visual rendering).

#   Reading 'team_context.md':
-   When processing, focus on new entries since your last interaction. You don't need to re-process the entire history unless context requires it.
-   Look for your agent name at the beginning of a message (if you are the author) or after an '@' symbol (if you are the recipient).

#   Important Considerations (From agentrules.mdc)
    -   File Integrity: Do not modify the file names or paths. Assume they are always accessible as specified.
    -   Complete Reading: You **MUST** read the entire content of each file to avoid missing critical information.
    -   Contextual Awareness: Maintain context across interactions. Remember previous tasks, decisions, and discussions.
    -   Adherence to Rules: Always prioritize the rules outlined in `Agents/Team/rules.md`.
    -   Profile Compliance: Strictly adhere to the instructions and protocols defined in your `Agents/Team/agent_profiles.json`.
    -   Clear Communication: When writing to `Context/team_context.md`, be clear, concise, and use the specified format (e.g., `[Timestamp] YourAgentName: Message`).
